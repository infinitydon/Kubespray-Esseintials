# Kubespray Essentials

---

Kubespray is an opionated way of deploying kubernetes clusters using Ansible. It supports the following types of kubernetes deployment:

* Baremetal 
* Virtual Machines \(KVM, Vmware, VirtualBox\)
* Openstack
* Public clouds \(AWS, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean etc\)

It supports specific linux distribution versions which are Centos 7, Ubuntu 16, Debian Jessie and CoreoS \(Contianer Linux\).

This book is aimed at helping those who are preparing for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator Exam through based on the kubernauts committee efforts, though it can be used as a reference for kubernetes cluster administration generally.

This guide will make use of both kube-spray-cli and native ansible mode of deployment. Both ways are almost the same but as usual variety is the spice of life, whichever you choose, you are guaranteed of getting an awesome kubernetes deployment.

I hope this adds value to your kubernetes journey.

Get ready for some awesome winds below your kubernaut wings!
